# Head Shape and Age Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains the computational aspects of an MSc thesis project in biology, focused on analyzing head shape dimensions and their correlation with age. The analysis includes various statistical methods, classification models and machine learning techniques to explore the relationships between biometric features and age groups. 
**Note: This project is part of my colleague's MSc thesis in biology and I am assisting with the computational analysis.**

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and formatted to convert birth dates into age and group individuals into age categories.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Basic statistics and correlation matrices are generated to analyze the relationships between different physical features.
- **ANOVA**: Analysis of variance is conducted to test if there are significant differences in height across different age groups.
- **Classification Models**: Multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression, are used to classify individuals into age groups based on head shape features.
- **Regression Analysis**: Ridge and Lasso regression models are applied to predict height trends based on age.
- **Clustering (K-Means)**: Clustering analysis is performed to identify patterns in head shape dimensions.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction is applied to visualize the relationships between features in a two-dimensional space.

## Results
soon.
